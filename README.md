## About the Project
This project processes a text file containing a switch's IP access list and generates the necessary configuration commands to remove outdated entries and reorganize the access list in ascending IP address order.

I created this project to address the common issue of disorganized access lists at work, which often leads to unnecessary delays when locating the correct IP to add or remove. This tool is designed to help streamline and reorganize client switch access lists, making future modifications more efficient and reducing time spent on manual edits.


## Built With
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Prerequisites
   Before starting, make sure you have the following:
   - Python


## Usage
Work-In-Progress


## How It Works
Work-In-Progress


## Future Plans
[ ] Quick IP Check
- After discussing with a coworker, she confirmed that having a faster method to check whether a list of IPs exists in the access list would also significantly improve efficiency. I'd like to add this feature to the project, even though it wasn't part of the original goal, as it further enhances efficiency in our daily workflow.
