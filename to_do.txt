Example ACL:
    10 permit igmp any host 239.1.1.1
    20 permit igmp any host 239.1.1.5
    30 permit igmp any host 239.1.1.6
    40 permit igmp any host 239.1.1.12
    50 permit igmp any host 239.1.1.16
    60 permit igmp any host 239.1.1.22
    70 permit igmp any host 239.1.1.26
    80 permit igmp any host 239.1.1.7
    90 deny igmp any any

Due to privacy reasons, not everything that I input into the switches will be handled by this project.
This project just aims to sort the IP access-list for our clients. The example above is a cleaned and organized access-list, but in most cases, they are not.
The biggest rule is that "-- deny igmp any any" has to be the last one.
